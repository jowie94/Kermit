# The Kermit programming language
![Kermit](doc/img/kermit_keyboard.gif)
## What is Kermit?
Kermit is an interpreted, object oriented, dynamically typed, statically typed, generic and extensible language. It is being developed by me at HP Inc. as my bachelor's thesis for the FIB.

The main objective of the language is to assist developers in debugging and mocking tasks by executing instructions inside the target application.

It consists in a parser and an interpreter, one DLL for each component. The language is based in C (and derived), JavaScript and Python. It inherits constructions from these languages.

## Roadmap

The roadmap is divided in tasks which are listed in the issues sections with the `TODO` tag. The milestones are:
- [x] Implement a basic interpreter
- [ ] Support external (_native_) functions
- [ ] Support external (_native_) objects
- [ ] Correct code and solve all remaining TODOs

## Code examples
 // TODO

## How-to implement native functions
